Above you will find three files associated to this weeks assignment. If you prefer you can reading the Assignment Document (stored above as a Word document) on its own webpage in the docs folder.    

The script depends on the associated "WordList.dat" binary file being in the same directory. You can test with or without the binary file, as the script should generate a new file if it is not present.  

Thank you for reviewing my homework. If you have any questions, go ahead and shoot them my way.
